## Javascript Raycaster
Raycaster implementation using javascript and the canvas API. The program takes an array of integers and uses them to represent a flat, pseudo-3D level. By Incrementing over a programmer-specified FOV, the program casts rays and increments those rays until they intersect with a wall, at which point the program stores the distance to the wall from the player. Vertical strips are then drawn horizontally across the player's fov at varied heights (farther smaller, closer bigger) depending on their distance to the player to give the illusion of depth. This is the magic of raycasting!
